### Introducing Containers and Kubernetes

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand what containers are and how they improve the software life cycle.
- Recognize Kubernetes as a container orchestration tool.

### Introducing Containers and Container Engines

1. **Traditional Application Deployment:**
   - Applications (e.g., Python) are deployed on physical hosts or virtual machines.
   - Dependencies on host OS libraries (e.g., OpenSSL) can lead to unexpected breaks.
   - Maintenance requires extensive testing and staging environments.
   - Ensuring high availability and zero downtime updates is complex and requires load balancers and multiple VMs.

2. **Challenges with Traditional Deployment:**
   - Dependency issues with host OS libraries.
   - Complex testing and staging to prevent production issues.
   - Manual management of high availability and zero downtime updates.

3. **Introduction to Containers:**
   - Containers isolate processes from the system, similar to virtual machines but more lightweight.
   - They offer faster performance and lower resource needs without additional OS or kernels.

4. **Container Standards:**
   - Open Container Initiative (OCI) sets standards for container runtime and container images.
   - Examples of OCI-compliant engines: Docker, LXC, Podman, Rocket, Cryo.

5. **Advantages of Containers:**
   - **Low Hardware Footprint:** Lightweight without a full OS.
   - **Environment Isolation:** Crashes in one container do not affect others.
   - **Quick Deployment:** Fast startup due to their lightweight nature.
   - **Multiple Environment Deployment:** Allows independent updates of libraries and dependencies.
   - **Reusability:** One container image can be used for multiple purposes (dev, stage, prod).

6. **Disadvantages and Caveats:**
   - **Complex Applications:** Single-container deployments are less effective for complex applications.
   - **Hardware-Level Access:** Challenging for applications needing low-level hardware access.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Containers offer significant benefits for modern application deployment but have limitations.
   - Future steps include deeper exploration of containerization and container runtimes.

### Introducing Kubernetes and Container Orchestration

1. **Limitations of Manually Managing Containers:**
   - **Communication Management:** Becomes complex with many containers, issues with IP addresses, DNS names, and automated discovery.
   - **Resource Management:** Difficult to manage resource limits and allocation manually, handle resource-heavy applications, and balance workloads.
   - **Traffic Management:** Challenging with many containers; requires automated spawning/removal based on traffic.
   - **Rolling Updates:** Cumbersome without automation; manual management of replicas and load balancing is complex.

2. **Need for Container Orchestration:**
   - Manual management at scale is not feasible.
   - Automated solutions are required for discovery, resource management, traffic handling, and rolling updates.

3. **Introduction to Kubernetes:**
   - **Container Orchestration Platform:** Simplifies deployment, lifecycle management, and scaling of containers.
   - **Key Features:**
     - **Service Discovery:** Automated discovery of new applications, IP addresses, and DNS records.
     - **Self-Healing:** Automatically restarts crashed applications.
     - **Automated Rollout:** Zero downtime updates and automated load balancing.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Kubernetes addresses the challenges of managing large-scale containerized applications.
   - Features like service discovery, self-healing, and automated rollouts simplify container management.
